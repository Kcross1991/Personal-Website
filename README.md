My Personal Website for Block 11
My motivation for this project was to learn how to make a website. It is also coursework that I need to complete
I built this project to help test my skill on the tags and elements I have learned in the past two weeks.
This website was made for people to understand who I am
I learned a lot more things about tags work and how how to group elements together.
